# Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator

This Python program calculates the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of a 3x3 matrix. The matrix is provided as a flat list of 9 numbers.

NumPy is used to perform the mathematical operations efficiently on the 3x3 matrix.
This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python course.

## Features

Calculate mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum for each column, each row, and the entire matrix.
